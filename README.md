# Pokedex

Very simple app to practice using a few different packages:

- redux
- redux-thunk
- react-paginate
- react-router-dom

Front end is very basic and I only show a portion of the info available in the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) but the main aim was to set up routing correctly, further my knowledge of Redux / Redux-thunk, add pagination to my site and finally correctly render components via links.
